### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd poetry-platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up MongoDB:
   - Install MongoDB locally or create a MongoDB Atlas account
   - Create a database named `poetry-platform`
   - Note your MongoDB connection string

4. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/poetry-platform
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
PORT=5000
```

5. Create uploads directory:
